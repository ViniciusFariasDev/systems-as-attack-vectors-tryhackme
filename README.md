# Systems as Attack Vectors - TryHackMe

This repository documents my completion of the **"Systems as Attack Vectors"** room on TryHackMe.

The purpose of this lab is to understand how systems can become attack vectors due to vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and poor patch management, and how to reduce risk through secure practices.
